Forecasting The Bachelorette 🌹📈

This project aims to forecast the outcomes of The Bachelorette TV show using historical contestant data, personal attributes, and competition progression features. The goal is to build a predictive model that can estimate which contestant is most likely to win.

📌 Project Overview
Using public data from past seasons, this notebook analyzes contestant characteristics, show dynamics, and model performance to forecast the final rose recipient. It applies machine learning techniques to uncover patterns and factors that contribute to a contestant's success.
